Surooh SCP KeyKit — Chat ↔ Central Core

This file explains the safe placeholders and how to populate them without including numeric examples.

Secrets
- CHAT_HMAC_SECRET: paste a hex secret generated by your crypto tool.
- CENTRAL_HMAC_SECRET: paste a hex secret generated by your crypto tool.
- JWT_SECRET: paste a hex secret generated by your crypto tool.

How to generate secrets
- Use your platform's cryptographic random generator to produce a hex string.
- Keep secrets in a secure vault. Do not commit to source control.
- Rotate secrets regularly according to your security policy.

Notes on SRH_ROOT_SIGNATURE
- This identifier is not a secret. It is a stable token used to mark messages as originating from the sovereign core.
- Keep it consistent across environments.

Testing hint (manual)
- Compute HMAC of the exact raw body using the secret for the sender side.
- Send request with header X-Surooh-Signature set to the computed hex HMAC.
- Include a valid JWT Bearer token in Authorization header when required.

Storage and rotation
- Store secrets in a secrets manager or vault.
- Use environment variables in runtime to reference secrets.
- Implement a rotation grace window to avoid outages when rolling keys.
