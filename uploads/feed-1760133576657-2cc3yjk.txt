Nucleus 2.0 - Surooh Empire Knowledge Base

This is a test document for the Knowledge Feed system. The system is designed to process uploaded files, extract text, chunk them into manageable pieces, and store them in a Vector Database for semantic search.

Key Features of Nucleus 2.0:
1. Intelligent Core Brain with decision-making capabilities
2. Meta-Governance Layer for coordinating child brains
3. System Pulse Monitor for health tracking
4. Evolving Memory Hub for historical learning
5. Knowledge Feed system for ingesting external knowledge

The Knowledge Feed system supports multiple file formats:
- Plain text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Microsoft Word documents (.docx)

Each file is processed through the following steps:
1. Upload and validation (max 20MB)
2. Text extraction based on file type
3. Content hash generation for duplicate detection
4. Text chunking (800-1000 words per chunk)
5. Vector embedding and storage in Upstash Vector DB
6. Integration with Meta Layers (Memory, Governance, Pulse)

The system maintains a complete audit trail of all knowledge ingestion operations, including:
- File metadata (name, size, type, uploader)
- Processing status (queued, processing, completed, error)
- Chunk count and summary
- Processing time and timestamps

This enables Surooh Empire to build a comprehensive knowledge base that can be queried semantically, supports decision-making, and evolves over time through continuous learning.
